Auomated Dump via ImgBurn: Batch file(s) for mass ripping of optical media (CD and DVD)

Version: Alpha 1
The inital release of ADvIB.

This is relatively simply CMD-extended batch file I wrote to help me rip a large library of console games (PS1 and PS2) 
to a hard drive for archival purposes. The only thing it does is use variable and a one-game-per-line text file to convert
the disc to a bin/cue or ISO file, depending on the type. 

It is currently in a usable state but without any of the "niceties" of a normal, user-friendly utility (like running it with
no paramters giving you a help paragraph on how to use it or double-checking to make sure ImgBurn.exe exists).

The current plan is to add the nicities and as well as further features such as a config file to save settings. I would also like 
re-write the whole thing as an HTA in HTML/JScript (and since I want learn PowerShell maybe that too).
